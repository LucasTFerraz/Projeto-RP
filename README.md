# Projeto-RP

This is a University Project for the Pattern Recognition Discipline. We replicated a previous studied focusing on the energetic effience of SNNs. In order to do so, we used 3 datasets to measure framework's energetic effiency. It can be seen in #Models Used. 

If you are trying to replicate it, first, run the main framework with PyTorch and Spikingjelly, the second one with Keras and Sklearn(PyTorch) and the third one with PyTorch.

This project uses the architectures Resnet20, VGG16, ResNet50.
